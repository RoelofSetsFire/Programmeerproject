# Programmeerproject

This project aims to show the amount of money that is spent on or in the name of pseudo-science,
like the Myer Briggs personality type test. The main visualization will be a bar-chart (A in the sketch),
color coded to differentiate between merely unproven or actually disproven pseudo-science. Clicking
a bar chart should lead to background information (C) on what the specific item actually entails,
link to or reference articles, and display other relevant or interesting information such as
global popularity(B), graphs with measured effect sizes and the like.

To enhance the participation of the users a quiz will also be added, possibly making them choose between
real and pseudo-science? Finishing the quiz should report interesting stats on the person taking the quiz
as well as the person before them. The quiz will touch upon the same science as the rest of the page.

* Chart on spending on pseudo-science (MVP)
* Background info and related charts (MVP)
* Reference to articles (Optional)
* Quiz (MVP)
* Stats related to quiz (Optional)


##Possible limitations that could arise

The main limitation that I can see arising is a lack of hard data; if this happens however the choice for
less clear data could be made in order to still make a visualization.

Ways to make the subject matter interesting and visually appealing will also have to be looked at; while
safe a bar-chart isn't exactly sexy, so research into other options is a legitimate consideration.

Technically the biggest difficulty is going to be implementing the quiz, as this would require a database/sql
if it is to be implemented in it's most interesting form. With the help at hand this should not be a problem
that cannot be overcome though.


### review of similar visualization
None found so far. First thing tomorrow should be to keep looking.

# Modules

## Main page

Title (TBD) on the centre of the page, with a paragraph outline the goal of the site as well as explain its functionality. Aim is a clean and professional look without being boring. Following the introduction will be a D3 generated graph of the main data (amount of money spent on bogus/unproven science/medicine) as a chart (probably bar). This chart should be fairly basic; just representing the different amounts for the different keys. When clicked an outline describing the subject as well as links to scientific articles on their effectivity should appear to the right. A number of charts (also D3) related to the subject (number can vary from one to the others) should also appear. The main chart should be replaced by all this information, with a button allowing the user to return. (See sketch 1).

Due to varying amounts of data the easiest way to store and retrieve it will be one or multiple JSON objects.

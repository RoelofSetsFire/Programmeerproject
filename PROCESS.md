# Day 2

* looked up pseudoscience subjects:
  * Homeopathy
  * Chiropractic
  * Psychics (might have to subdivide)
  * Astrology (again might have to subdivide)
  * Acupuncture
  * Faith healing/reiki (maybe seperate?)
  * Aromatherapy

* articles on this subject exist, hardly any use visualizations though; look into other visualizations only semi-related?

* Found a reference for the quiz: https://github.com/kuangkeng/keng-data-journalism/tree/gh-pages/timeuseform
* And another: http://jsfiddle.net/natmit/7Du6N/

* Maybe add comparison with actual science/medicine?

* As a chart [this one](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iTuAtoblCNE/UIqi0jGud9I/AAAAAAAAAYk/987EjabXKjU/s640/graph%25284%2529.jpg), while basic, works. Boxes clearer maybe? Different font/numbers?

# Day 3

* Question raised during stand-up on whether linking to other visualization actually qualifies as linked views. Find out if this is the case and if not find ways to add linked interactivity.

* Add number of practitioners as little figures!

* xkcd style graphs; might not be useful now but keeping a link; http://engineering.ooyala.com/blog/how-create-xkcd-style-charts-using-javascript-and-d3

* Possibly use Angular? https://angularjs.org/

# Day 4

* Learned about version checking in html; neat-o!

* Resizing/moving stuff around is going to require good grasp of selection: https://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/

* Resizing with function guide; http://eyeseast.github.io/visible-data/2013/08/28/responsive-charts-with-d3/


# Week 2
# Day 1

* Working on a function to dynamically create graphs for each category (necessary because different kind of graphs): little documentation online but a foreach with clear tagging should work

* Decided on a button for choosing different lines within a new graph; easier to code with the added bonus of interactivity!

# Day 2

* Haven't gotten the button to work yet, decided to put the chart functions in a separate function to make it easier to fiddle around with and not destroy my entire visualization.

* Not only going to need line charts but also bar; started work on a function for that.

# Day 3

* Function for bar chart working as intended

* Added animation to the pie chart

# Week 3
# Day 2

* makeLine working and adding buttons to activate/deactivate lines

* Made different svg's on the html to make layout easier

# Day 3

* Toying with layout variations all day, changing names and ways of binding things. Nothing is really sticking out as convenient or useful.

# Day 4

* Working with divs is working quite well, experimenting with percentages instead of fixed ranges to make project more flexible.

* Getting things ready for presentation, making some temporary data because main data is mostly unformatted yet

# Week 4
# Day 1

* All functions in the main java script makes sense as the main body of java script is not turning out so big

* Getting glyphicons to work is not going as intended, they keep going over each other

# Day 2

* Glyphicons -still- not working as intended, getting really frustrated

# Day 3

* Putting the final data in csv files is turning out to be massively more complicated than expected

* Functions mostly working as intended, just need to add linking elements

# Day 4

* Data is still giving me massive headaches, working hard to get things done

* Better styling is probably not going to be an option time wise

* Report is rather vague; ask other people what they have to compare

# Day 2

* looked up pseudoscience subjects:
  * Homeopathy
  * Chiropractic
  * Psychics (might have to subdivide)
  * Astrology (again might have to subdivide)
  * Acupuncture
  * Faith healing/reiki (maybe seperate?)
  * Aromatherapy

* articles on this subject exist, hardly any use visualizations though; look into other visualizations only semi-related?

* Found a reference for the quiz: https://github.com/kuangkeng/keng-data-journalism/tree/gh-pages/timeuseform
* And another: http://jsfiddle.net/natmit/7Du6N/

* Maybe add comparison with actual science/medicine?

* As a chart [this one](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iTuAtoblCNE/UIqi0jGud9I/AAAAAAAAAYk/987EjabXKjU/s640/graph%25284%2529.jpg), while basic, works. Boxes clearer maybe? Different font/numbers?
